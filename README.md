This is the 2022/2023 project for Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization course.
<br> 
---
The problem presented is the Multiple Couriers Programming.<br>
Different strategies have been used:
- Constraint Programming with MiniZinc
- SAT-Solvers with Z3
- SMT-Solvers with Z3
- Mixed Integer Programming with MIP
---
